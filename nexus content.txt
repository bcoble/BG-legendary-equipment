## Mod page
This mod bring back the powerful and nostalgic legendary weapons from the original Baldur's Gate games. Craft and wield the likes of Crom Faeyr or Carsomyr once again.

It prioritizes accuracy over balance. Items are kept as close to the originals as possible.


## Detailed Description
This mod is for fans of the original Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 like myself. While BG3 has many amazing things, it missed the mark on finding cool items to combine together for awesome gear. Where are my vorpal swords? Where is my dragon scale plate?

My plan is to add many more weapons and armor as I can over time. Equipment in this mod will either be crafted or found in lore friendly locations. Feedback is always welcome. Enjoy!
