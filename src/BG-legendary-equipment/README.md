# BG1 And BG2 Legendary Equipment Mod
Author: ToaVee
Version: 0.0.1-alpha

A mod to bring back the powerful and nostalgic legendary weapons from the original Baldur's Gate games. Craft and wield the likes of Crom Faeyr or Carsomyr once again.

This mod prioritizes accuracy over balance. Items are kept as close to the originals as possible.

Early versions of this mod will include simple crafting capabilities by clicking on anvils or directly in the inventory. I hope to eventually leverage Dammon or maybe invite Cespinar to help...

I give full permission to reuse my mod in mod packs or porting, with credit to this mod.

## Detailed Description
This mod is for fans of the original Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 like myself. While BG3 has many amazing things, it missed the mark on finding cool items to combine together for awesome gear. Where are my vorpal swords? Where is my dragon scale plate?

My plan is to add many more weapons and armor as I can over time. Equipment in this mod will either be crafted or found in lore friendly locations. Feedback is always welcome. Enjoy!
