BG1 AND BG2 LEGENDARY EQUIPMENT - 1.0
A mod to bring back the powerful and nostalgic legendary weapons from the original Baldur's Gate games. Craft and wield the likes of Crom Faeyr or Carsomyr once again.

This mod prioritizes accuracy over balance. Items are kept as close to the originals as possible.

Early versions of this mod will include simple crafting capabilities by clicking on anvils or directly in the inventory. I hope to eventually leverage Dammon or maybe invite Cespinar to help...

I give full permission to reuse my mod in mod packs or porting, with credit to this mod.
